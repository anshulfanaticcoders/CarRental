Session summary - Renteon integration/debug

Key outcomes
- Renteon availability now uses pickup as dropoff for search and RenteonCarController.
- Search results now resolve Renteon provider_pickup_id when missing, using unified_locations.json and provider=renteon, so direct URLs work.
- Renteon search switched to default provider (demo) instead of all providers to avoid 60s timeout and empty results.
- BookingExtrasStep now always shows View Booking Details button.
- BookingExtrasStep root wrapped in a single div to remove Vue fragment class warning.
- Renteon optional extras now render from renteonOptionalExtras and update booking summary totals.

Verified
- Search URL with provider=renteon now shows vehicles.
- Selecting a Renteon extra updates booking summary total.
- Backend API test produced booking number 26-001-2 (demo provider) with voucher VRM-TEST-001.
